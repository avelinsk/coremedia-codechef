Code Kata Password checker

Write a program that reads in a string from the command line and a dictionary of words from standard input (e.g. from a file containing a dictionary), and checks whether it is a "good" password. Here, assume "good" means that it

(i) is at least 8 characters long,

(ii) is not a word in the dictionary,

(iii) is not a word in the dictionary followed by a digit 0-9 (e.g., hello5),

(iv) is not two words separated by a digit (e.g., hello2world).

Think about how to test your program.
