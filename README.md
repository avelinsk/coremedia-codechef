## Example: Word Chain

Find the shortest word chain between "lead" and "gold". 

A word chain is a chain of words where every word differs from its predecessor by only a single character.

* "lead" -> "load" -> "goad" -> "gold"

The algorithm shown here also supports the adding or removing of a single character, so that it is possible to
find even longer chains like

*  "mouse" -> "muse" -> "must" -> "mast" -> "cast" -> "cat" 
* "a" -> "ha" -> "he" -> "de" -> "ode" -> "rode" -> "rods" -> "reds" -> "reeds" -> "creeds" 
-> "creeks" -> "cheeks" -> "cheeky" -> "cheesy" -> "cheese"
